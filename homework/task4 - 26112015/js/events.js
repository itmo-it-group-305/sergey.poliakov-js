    descrition: "After Rattle and Hum, U2 went away to 'dream it all up again.' Achtung Baby was widely regarded as a sonic and visual reinvention of the band: a step too far in some territories, where Adam's nude image on the sleeve was covered with an appropriately fixed X or clover. At U2's request, Achtung Baby was the first album by a major act to be released in two eco-friendly packages - the jewel box (without the long box attachment) and the cardboard Digi-Trak. The Digi-Trak featured long-box sizes cardboard, which, once its shrink-wrap and two plastic struts are removed, folds around the CD. In Germany, Universal released a 2-CD box set with a copy of both Achtung Baby and Zooropa.",

    description: "U2 play a concert in Sarajevo; they were the first major group to perform there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the concert as 'an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile.'",

    description: "Bono and U2 will make the most of any size platform given them. Not everybody knew that when drummer Larry Mullen Jr. counted off Sunday Bloody Sunday at London's Wembley Stadium, but they sure did 17 minutes later, when the band left the stage. 'They always had ambitions to be the biggest band in the world,' says Rolling Stone contributing editor Anthony DeCurtis, 'and Bono, in particular, understood what a performance in front of an audience of that size could mean.' During a 12-minute rendition of Bad that incorporated bits of Lou Reed and Rolling Stones songs, Bono climbed down from the stage to help security guards extricate three girls from the crush of the crowd. That bit of improvisation cost the band the chance to play its lone U.S. Top 40 hit, Pride (In the Name of Love), but it vaulted the group to a new career stratus.",

    description: "The release of The Joshua Tree saw the band on the cover of Time Magazine billed as 'Rock's Hottest Ticket.' In Sweden, copies of The Joshua Tree were pressed in yellow, pink and red vinyl with sleeves similar to the UK. In Mexico, a limited edition CD was released as part of the Serie Millennium re-issues with a different picture sleeve. In 1999, The Joshua Tree CD was re-issued with the clear band photo that appeared on the original vinyl LP rather than the blurred picture on the initial CD release.",

A beautiful acoustic number, evidently still a work in progress, with Bono saying to Edge as they jammed towards the end, 'break down the chords to the middle eight again...''No-one has heard that before,' he added, 'Not even us.' We'll all be hearing it again.",

Other unusual releases from around the world included a Mexican release on the Bertelsmann label as part of the Rockollector series.
